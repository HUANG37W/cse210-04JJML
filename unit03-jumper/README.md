# The Jumper Game

## Description
### *The Jumper Game is similar to the US "Hangman" game. A random word is given and the player tries to guess the letters in the word. If the letter is in the word, the letter is displayed. If not the dash is displayed and the player loses part of his parachute. The game is over when the parachute is gone and the guy "dies" or the game is won by guessing the word*
